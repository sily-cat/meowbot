<!-- 
    if you fork this bot, please make your own html :3
    this uses the same styling as my main github pages website
    (even using the same files for css and rendering the footer)
    and has the link to specifically my version of the bot

    soooo

    if you end up using this code, please make your own index.html!!

	<h1>meowbot</h1>
    <p>a kinda useless discord bot</p>
    <p>created by @silyduct, hosted on deno deploy</p>
    <p>!!disclaimer!! - the account sily.cat was just falsely suspended by discord, so that's why the bot is now called meowbot-ii</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sily-cat/meowbot">source code</a></p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1328611134353178624">
            <button class="primary">add to your server/account!</button>
        </a>
    </p>
    <h2>current features:</h2>
    <p>/say - say a message (as a response to the slash command)</p>
    <p>/send - say a message (as the bot itself, only in guilds, requires "meowbot send" role)</p>
    <p>/cat - send a cat image from thecatapi (with a button to send another)</p>
    <p>/meow - send a random cat noise from a list (dm me on discord to suggest more!)</p>
    <p>/ping - ping the bot and get the deno deploy server it's running on</p>
    <p>/octad [generate, solve]* - something kinda complicated i may explain later</p>
    <p>/catness [user] - gets the % cat someone is</p>
    <p>/wipers - returns whether windshield wipers are on sale today or not</p>
